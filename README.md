# 📝 Just a README

Welcome to my repository… which currently contains **only this README**.  
No code. No files. Just pure documentation energy.  

## Why?
- Testing GitHub features  
- Practicing commits and pushes  
- Procrastinating real work  

## Future Plans
Maybe I’ll add actual code.  
Maybe I’ll just keep writing README files forever.  
Who knows? 🤷


*Thanks for stopping by! You’ve basically read the whole project.*
